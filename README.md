## 🕵️‍♂️ TurtleBot3 Detection and Monitoring System

This project is a watching and tracking system using **TurtleBot3**, integrated with **CCTV cameras**, **YOLO object detection**, and **Flask** for a real-time monitoring UI. The system is designed to track and pursue vehicles dynamically, ensuring robust monitoring and security.

<br>
<br>

## 📋 Project Features

- **CCTV Integration**: Monitors the entire map using real-time camera feeds.
- **YOLO Object Detection**: Detects and tracks vehicles with unique IDs for real-time tracking.
- **Flask UI**: It shows the cctv screen, enters the ID of the object to be tracked, and shows coordinate information in real time.
- **Dynamic Vehicle Tracking**: Converts image coordinates from the CCTV to TurtleBot3’s spatial coordinates and transmits them.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes SQLite for storing tracking information and generating statistical reports.
- **ROS2 Communication**: Facilitates seamless communication between components.
